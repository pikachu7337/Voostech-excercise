Exercise 1: Basics  Write a Python program that takes the name of the user as an input and prints "Hello, user-name".  Write a Python program to determine the grade of a student in a course given his/her score using if, el-if and else statements. (70-100=A, 60-69=B, 50-59=C, 40-49=D, &lt;40=F).  Modify the program in (2) to print the full meaning of each grade point as follows (A=Excellent, B=Very good, C=Good, D=Pass and F= Fail).  Write a program to print all even numbers between 1 and 100 using: while and for loop  Modify the program in (4) to store the even numbers in a list.  Print the content of the list created in (5) using: while and for statements.  Extract the logic for printing the content of the list in (6) into a separate function. Call the function from your main method/function.  Write a function that received 3 arguments. Adds up the first two arguments and store the result in the 3rd argument. Explore the concept of mutable and immutable types. Print the result of the addition inside the main method.  Write a program to create and print the content of a 2x2 matrix using for and while loop.  Write a program to perform matrix addition of 2 square matrices (use 2x2 matrices for simplicity)
